# Reddit r/Syllo App frontend source code archive

Extracted from [https://www.reddit.com/r/syllo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/syllo/). Saved using the Chrome extension [Save All Resources](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-all-resources/abpdnfjocnmdomablahdcfnoggeeiedb).

### How is this possible?

Because Reddit forgot to disable sourcemaps in production on the r/Syllo app 🙃

I've archived them here on GitHub for educational purposes.
