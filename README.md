# Reddit Syllo App frontend source code archive

Extracted from [https://syllo-app-evua8s-0-0-93-webview.devvit.net/](https://syllo-app-evua8s-0-0-93-webview.devvit.net/). Saved using the Chrome extension [Save All Resources](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-all-resources/abpdnfjocnmdomablahdcfnoggeeiedb).

### How is this possible?

Because Reddit forgot to disable sourcemaps in production on the Syllo Prod website 🙃

As an interesting discovery, I've archived them here on GitHub for educational purposes.
